\noindent \textbf{Appendix A}
\vspace{12pt}

\noindent Appendices at the end of a dissertation are optional, and depend on the content of the dissertation. There can be one or more appendicies, however they should retain the page numbering requirements for dissertations.  Any concerns about the formatting of an appendix should be brought to Doris Oliver, who can direct you how to format your appendix if you have questions.
