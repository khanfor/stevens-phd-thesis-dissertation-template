In addition, an abstract is required as part of the PhD.  If your abstract is longer than 350 words, UMI (the publisher of dissertations) might edit your abstract to 350 words. It is in your best interest to do the editing yourself.

The requirements are as follows:   Title of document on top;  Abstract of document (350 words or fewer); Author's name on bottom; Advisor's name on bottom; Date on bottom; Department at bottom; Degree on bottom; The abstract should be the first page where page numbers appear, starting with page number iii (or page ii if a copyright page is not included).
