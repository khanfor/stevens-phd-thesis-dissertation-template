%% Use the following commands, if desired, during production.
%% Comment them out for final version.
%\usepackage{layout} % defines the \layout command, see below
%\setlength{\hoffset}{-.75in} % creates a large right margin for notes and \showlabels

\pagestyle{fancy}

%% Page layout (customized to letter paper and NYU requirements):

%% Use the line below for official NYU version, which requires
%% double line spacing. For all other uses, this is unnecessary,
%% so the line can be commented out.
\onehalfspacing % requires package setspace, invoked above

%% Each of the following lines defines the \com command, which produces
%% a comment (notes for yourself, for instance) in the output file.
%% Example:    \com{this will appear as a comment in the output}

%\newcommand{\com}[1]{[/// {#1} ///]}       % between [/// and ///].
\newcommand{\com}[1]{\marginpar{\tiny #1}} % as (tiny) margin notes
%\newcommand{\com}[1]{}                     % suppress all comments.
